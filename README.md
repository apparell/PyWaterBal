Unsaturated Soil Water Flow Model

by [Christopher Teh Boon Sung](http://www.christopherteh.com)

## Overview

PyWaterBal is a unsaturated soil water flow model. It models the vertical flow (one-dimensional) of water in the soil, following a "tipping bucket" system. This model was published as a [`book by Uni. Putra Malaysia Press`](http://www.christopherteh.com/soilwaterbook/) (also see references below).



## Installation

1. To simplify the installation process, download the [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) suite. **Make sure you only choose the Python version 3.5 or higher (NOT ver 2.7).** Downloading the [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) suite will include not only the Python interpreter but also the `matplotlib` module which is required by PyWaterBal.

1. Download the entire [`PyWaterBal`](https://github.com/cbsteh/PyWaterBal/archive/master.zip) repository.

## How to use

At the command prompt:

```text
    python pywaterbal.py <flags>
```

where `<flags>` are the following:

```text
    -i <model input text file>
    -o <model output/results text file>
    -n <number of daily time steps to run the model, in days>
    -p <plot charts to show the model results, optional>
```

The `-p` flag is optional and must either be `b` for basic chart plotting. For detailed chart plotting, use any single letter other than `b`.

Example:

```text
    python pywaterbal -i 'c:\pywaterbal\ini.txt'
                      -o 'c:\pywaterbal\out.txt'
                      -n 90
                      -pb or -pd
```

means the model input is `ini.txt` and output file is `out.txt`, and both these files are stored in `c:\pywaterbal\` folder. The model is to be run for 90 simulation days, and after the model run, the simulation results will be plotted. The 'basic' chart plots will be produced if `-pb` is specified, else `-pd` for more detailed charts.
